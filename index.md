Imagine a world where you can pick up a phone and talk in English,
while at the other end of the line your words are spoken in Chinese.
Imagine a computer animated representation of yourself speaking
fluently what you have written in an email. Imagine automatically
uncovering protein/drug     interactions in terabytes of medical
abstracts. Imagine feeding a computer an ancient script that no
living person can read, then listening as the comput    er reads
aloud in this dead language. Natural Language Processing is the
automatic analysis of human languages such as English, Korean, and
thousands of o    thers analyzed by computer algorithms. Unlike
artificially created programming languages where the structure and
meaning of programs is easy to encode, hu    man languages provide
an interesting challenge, both in terms of its analysis and the
learning of language from observations.
