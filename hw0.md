Homework & Leaderboard setup
=============================================================

For this course, we use [an automated homework submission
system](http://sfu-nlp-class.appspot.com) built on [Google App
Engine](https://appengine.google.com). One component of this system
is the [leaderboard](leaderboard.html), which introduces a competitive
element into the assignments with realtime display of group submissions
according to their scores on assignment metrics.

You should follow the steps in this document to make sure that
everything is working for you.

0. Join a group. The maximum group size is four. Decide on a group
name. Make it memorable. Register yourself as a group on
[Coursys](https://courses.cs.sfu.ca).

1. Visit the course submission page at
[sfu-nlp-class.appspot.com](http://sfu-nlp-class.appspot.com). At
least one person in your group will need a valid Google account.

2. This system is used to upload all homework assignments. You
should use your group name as the handle when you submit your
assignment. By default the leaderboard will use your Google nickname
which cannot be used to assign your group a grade.

3. Homework 0 (this one) has been activated. Use the file submission
dialog to upload your submissions. 

## Homework 0

Homework 0 expects a file containing a single number. The leaderboard
displays a simple nonmonotonic function of this number, and sorts
the entries according to the highest value. Obtain a score above
the default score using a valid group name (verifiable from
courses.cs.sfu.ca) to get full marks.
