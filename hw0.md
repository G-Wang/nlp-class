Homework & Leaderboard setup
=============================================================

For this course, we use [an automated homework submission system](http://sfu-nlp-class.appspot.com)
built on [Google App Engine](https://appengine.google.com). One component of this system is the
[leaderboard](leaderboard.html), which introduces a competitive element into the assignments with
realtime display of student submissions according to their scores on assignment
metrics. Participation in the leaderboard is optional, and submissions are anonymized with a handle
of your choosing.

You should follow the steps in this document to make sure that everything is working for you.

0. Join a group. The maximum group size is four. Decide on a group name. Make it memorable. Register
yourself as a group on [Coursys](https://courses.cs.sfu.ca)

1. Visit the course submission page at [sfu-nlp-class.appspot.com](http://sfu-nlp-class.appspot.com). You
will need a Google account, if you don't already have one; use it to sign in.

2. This system is used to upload all homework assignments. You should use your group name
as the handle when you submit your assignment. By default it will keep your Google nickname
which cannot be used to give you a grade.

3. Homework 0 (this one) has been activated. Use the file submission
dialog to upload your submissions. 

## Homework 0

Homework 0 expects a file containing a single number. The leaderboard displays a simple
nonmonotonic function of this number, and sorts the entries according to the highest value.
